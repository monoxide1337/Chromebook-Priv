<h1>Chromebook Privilege Escalation</h1>

<h3>( WARNING ) - this does reset the chromebook, and resets all data, WIFI passwords, google accounts & settings.</h3>
 
( intro ) - i found this while just working on the the chromebook in robotics class, i was just exploring settings when i saw the powerwash (reset) button was disabled by ORG AKA (School), i thought to myself how could i reset the chromebook, sign in as a business and basically create my own ORG, and manage every user that logins to the chromebook.

( Part 0x1 ) 

- Turn off chromebook
- Press and hold the Esc key, refresh key, and the power button at the same time, wait for it to turn on
- You will see a white screen that says (Chrome OS is missing or damaged), hold ctrl and D, wait for the chromebook to restart
Dev-mode should be enabled now, and now the chromebook has been reset
It will say checking for updates, then prompt u to enter a WIFI, u either skip and enter guest mode and go to the wifi settings and go tell the teacher that the wifi got sign out and ask her to put it back in, after signout of guest mode and continue with the setup.
Or just enable your hotspot on your phone and connect to WIFI from your own manageable network


Now it will ask u to sign in as a ORG or a user, there is TWO options u can choose from, ORG manages all users under a domain name, basic user will just manage all users under that chromebook (Part 0xno2 will be about ORG only), if u wish to continue as a user u are done sign into a google account u have made NOT your school email. And now u have Ownership of the chromebook, manage users as u wish!


( Part 0x2 )

- Vist (https://workspace.google.com/business/signup/welcome?hl=en&source=gafb-homepage-canvas-en&ga_region=noram&ga_country=us&ga_lang=en)
- Create an account for the link above ^ (Use Fake INFO), for a domain u can use a site like freenom, for free domains and edit the MX records to googles mailing server. 

Once account has been registered it should be like nano@iownyourschool.cf, go back to the chromebook and instead of registering a user click sign in as ORG, and use your       business account that u created and sign in, then u should be done and u your ORG name will appear at the bottom of the signin screen. 


End Result ADMIN of the chromebook <3 love yall nano out-
